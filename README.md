# BD_Rhapsody_local     
to run BD_Rhapsody pipeline locally   
      
this basically serves the analysis of public datasets     
( [GurtnerA et al. Nature2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36509106/) )
            
for proj. Nmur1-EOS(https://github.com/Ruismart/Nmur1-EOS)

according to [the latest update info](https://scomix.bd.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047408451-BD-Rhapsody-Analysis-Pipeline-Updates)        
the pipeline has been modified with much better performance, glad to hear it              
(then the way to build it locally is also changed, e.g. the structure of reference index)    
(just check the official manuals for details)
